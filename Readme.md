# Invoice Dashboard UI

> Beautifully redesigned Dashboard UI software product with [Bunifu UI Framework](https://devtools.bunifu.co.ke/).

## Getting Started

If you'll be running the solution in *Visual Studio*, please ensure you have a copy of [Bunifu UI Framework](https://devtools.bunifu.co.ke/) to proceed in doing so. However, a copy of the executable is included in the project's *Debug* folder.

### Pre-requisites

- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2012](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and above.
- [Bunifu UI Framework](https://devtools.bunifu.co.ke/) (Premium version)

### Deployment

By default, you will require [.NET 4.5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/guide-for-developers) and above to run the executable on client machines; this can however be modified in *Visual Studio* by changing the .NET reference-setting in the **Project** Tab under **Invoices Dashboard Properties...** to work with [.NET 4.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/guide-for-developers).
